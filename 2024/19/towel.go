		- For a given sequence, identify the longest towels that can fit.
		- For each fitting towel, place it to create a matched subsequence & sub-sequences that require matches.
		- For each subsequence, recursively attempt to identify the longest towel that can fit.
		- A sequence is matched if a fitting towel is found & there are no sub-sequences, or every sub-sequence is recursively matched
